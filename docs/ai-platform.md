# AI Platform Setup

![AI Platform overview](/img/ai-platform/overview.png)

This page will cover the setup of our AI Platform.

## Create New Notebook


## Allow ML Team to Access the Resources

By default, AI Platform only allows Project Editor to access the Notebook. However, we can use AI Platform service account to add other user to access the resource. This is also allign with the principle of least privilege that only allows user to access the required previledges.
